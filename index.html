            Compassion ideally means “to suffer with”.

Dalai Lama said “If you want others to be happy, practice compassion.
If you want to be happy, practice compassion.” So what is it that makes this term and act so incredible? Compassion motivates people to go out of their way to help the physical, mental, or emotional pains of another and themselves. So, in a sense. it makes us better human beings.

To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Especially when compassion is one of your tools. Then the next elephant in the room to be acknowledged, becomes ” How to harness it?”.

Compassion involves “feeling for another” and is a precursor to empathy, the “feeling as another”. Practising which, helps us revert what looks like a bleak future, in someone else’s life. It enables one to look through the wider canvas. It makes us want to experience the world in the other person’s shoes. It motivates us to go share their emotions. Enhancing our kindness and altruism, it makes us more desirable and favourable.

An act of compassion is defined by its helpfulness. Qualities of compassion are patience and wisdom; kindness and perseverance; warmth and resolve. It can very often be confused for sympathy. The key difference being, that the former responds to suffering from sorrow and concern while the latter responds with warmth and care. Acts of compassion are often associated with positive psychology and foster fondness. They usher in a sense of togetherness and binds the individuals together. New friendships are formed, and old ones are renewed. Hence, it can act as a miracle portion. One that connects and mends.

In fact, it is of great significance, even in the study of Neurobiology!

Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health and LABS-D’Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving. In their research, they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species.

Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable. The same study has shown a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding.

The moral of the story!? Compassion is the key to connection. Not only with others but also with oneself. Its’ rewards are not only healthier social relations, but also psychological satisfaction. So the next time you get a chance to be compassionate, take it. It might be more satisfying than you expect!
